# reader-s_and_writer-s_utopia
Name: Reader's and Writer's Utopia

Live App: https://samrinhasib.github.io/reader-s_and_writer-s_utopia/

*A user is referred to as a writer because the site is meant to target writers (and readers of course).

Overall: 
A welcome page for the writer, explaining what each part of the app does. The explanation is as follows:
The writer will be able to search for books recommended by the New York Times (NYT) by genre. 
The writer will be able to look up book reviews on New York Times.
The writer will be able to use Google Books to search up the best deals for textbooks. (either to buy or rent).
The writer will be able to check out works on Wordpress.
The writer will be able to access stories publicly available on Wordpress.

There are be four pages available in total; in addition, there will be buttons leading them elsewhere on the homepage (to the textbooks, wordpress or NYT pages.)

-The Home Page, welcoming the writer and telling them what the app can do.
-On the Study page, the writer will have the ability to look up text books. The user will submit the name of a book and author or just the name; they will get 5 matching results if there are five results available on the API or less if there are less available. If only an author is entered, the writer will get an error telling him/her to insert a name.
-On the Read page, the writer will have the ability to search for bestsellers according to genre and book reviews.
The writer will choose an NYT category using a dropdown menu to find bestsellers and will receive the first ten results if there are more than ten or ten otherwise; by inserting a name into the input for the Name under "Find a Review", he or she will get a link to the NYT Review or be told that the review was not found.
-On the Help Peers Out page, the writer will be able to search for works of other users that are public on WordPress sing a keyword. Here, the writer can search up to 10 results but not more; he/she can set a max number.
